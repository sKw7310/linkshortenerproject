# Data Fetching Guidelines
This document outlines the data guidelines for fetching data in our next.js application. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency, maintainability across the codebase.

##1. **Use Server Components for Data Fetching.

In Next.js, ALWAYS use Server Components for the data fetching. NEVER use Client Components for data fetching.

##2 Data Fetching Methods

ALWAYS use the helper functions in the /data directory to fetch data. NEVER fetch dta directly in the components.

ALL helper functions in the /data directory should use Drizzle ORM for database interactions.
